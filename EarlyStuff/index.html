            <p>What degree and/or career path are you headed down?</p>
            <p>I am hoping to be a software engineer. What exactly that looks like, I am not sure at the moment.</p>
            <p>What are some of the things you love to do, hobbies?</p>
            <p>I like to play Dungeons & Dragons, read fantasy books, and play some video games with my friends and family.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Are you married, do you have children, grandchildren... </p>
            <p>Grandchildren?! No. I am still unmarried.</p>
            <p>What advantages do you see from learning about careers in web design, why you are taking the course, 
                what you hope to get out of it, and how you will use the information in your personal or professional life.</p>
            <p>I see it as an important skill to have. I plan on working with software, so I need to understand how they work.
                I don't know much about careers in software, so I need to learn that as well. I hope to use this information 
                to make better decisions regarding my career. I also would like to be able to make my own software for creative 
                purposes.</p>
            <p>How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?</p>
            <p>I have been my whole life. My parents were both raised members, and my great grandmother came over from 
                Switzerland to gather with the Saints</p>
            <p>Do you have a favorite quote from one of the leaders of the church?  Do you have a favorite scripture?</p>
            <p>A quote that I have liked recently is from Jeffery R. Holland. It says, "Every good thing that I know of in 
                this world you have to work at."</p>
            <p>Anything else you may want to share.</p>
            <p>No. Have a good day.</p>
